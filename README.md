"Bounce The Shark" is a example of a Flappy bird application written for iOS
using Objective C using the Cocos2D physics engine.

The end user controls a shark sprite and has to avoid obstacles such as toxic
waist bins, fish hooks and drift nets.  When the hero hits certain obstacles
such as coral or rocks it will boost the speed at which it swims.

As the hero progresses it collects coins and the level becomes darker and
harder. If the hero collides with a enemy obstacle such as a drift net or
hook, the user is given a choice of either watching a short video and
continuing or returning to the start of the game.

On completion of each level it was hoped that corporate sponsorship would
contribute a donation to coast watch or another organization dedicated to the
preservation of marine life, specifically sharks.
